## Summary

I am a structural analyst with over 20 years experience working in the space industry, with significant experience with deployable structures, composite materials design & optimization, non-linear dynamics, geometric non-linear behavior, as well as traditional loads and dynamics & structural integrity assessments.  I have consistently demonstrated innovation in simulation and mechanical test planning, execution, and data processing.  In particular, weaving test and simulation to predict and/or verify product performance particularly when 'test as you fly' is not practical or possible.  I have a passion for automation in simulation & test data processing, as well as building analytical tools to put specialized abilities into the hands of more engineers, technicians, and business development team members. I have excellent presentation & documentation skills and have demonstrated the ability to concisely distill and present complex topics in a digestible manner.

## Additional Professional Experience

***Keith Kedward & Associates*** | Santa Barbara, CA October 2005 - June 2013  
Assisted in the development of a comprehensive safety awareness course for FAA engineers. Authored subsections of the composite structures volume, created presentation material covering many topics related to composite aircraft structures, and assisted in review and presentation of structures-related sections.
Performed structural analysis of hydraulic and fuel isolators. Authored stress reports for customer review, presented results to Adel Wiggins (and their customers). Assisted in training the Adel Wiggins analysis group in ABAQUS for structural analysis of their fiber-wound composite aircraft products.  
Performed a detailed review of the Goodrich proprietary composite laminate code. Assisted in the development and presentation of a two-day (2006) and seven-day (2008) composite structures design course.

***Vision Composites Inc.*** | Signal Hill, CA - January 2003 - October 2003  
Developed test methods/procedures for composite laminate allowables and sub-assembly structural elements including tubular composite struts. Performed proof load testing on sub-assemblies incorporating multiple strain gauge bridge configurations. Reduced data and authored full test reports for flight structural sub-assemblies.

***Alphastar*** | Long Beach, CA - August 2002 - October 2003   
Performed analyses using the composite progressive damage analysis software package GENOA. Supported SBIR programs focused on developing analysis methodologies for composite naval ship structures. Compared traditional FE analysis initial and final failure predictions to the progressive damage predictions produced by GENOA for typical naval ship structural joints. Analyzed composite ceramic components exposed to extreme environments. Assisted in presenting analysis results to SBIR-related industry members for the development of new CFCC materials
